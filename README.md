# RIALY

RIALY(from "Building **RIA**s Easi**ly**") is a lightweight design pattern tool kit for [Adobe Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/).

+ RIALY reduces your application line of code and eliminates unmaintainable spaghetti code.
+ RIALY allows you to cleanly separate your views and your actions.
+ RIALY offers an IDE-free build process that uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and [Flexmojos](http://flexmojos.sonatype.org/).
+ RIALY builds the application in each environment such as "development" and "production".
